# The Cosmic Calculator

So I wanted to teach myself [React](https://reactjs.org/). I took a couple of beginner courses on Plural Sight and make a couple
of demo apps.  One of them is this [React](https://github.com/RedBirdOBX/StarMatchGame).

However, being the astronomy and science enthusiast that I am, I've always wanted to build a demo app to illustrate
just how big space really is. It seemed like a good excuse to practice with React so I built this demo app from scratch.
It's elementary and stacked to more experienced React developers, this is child's play.  The point of this app isn't really
what it does (anyone can do this with a calculator or spreadsheet) but <em>how</em> it does it.

Anyway, play with it and enjoy.  The app is at this url: [https://cosmic-calculator.azurewebsites.net/](https://cosmic-calculator.azurewebsites.net/)
